This is a compiler for the minimalist brainfuck programming language.
There's a description of how it works in the comments, and a few
example brainfuck files in this repo.

The brainfuck code is taken from examples on Wikipedia and programs on
www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf and esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck.

If you have an urge to see the assembly produced by this script, I
recommend installing nasm and using "ndisasm -u -e 84 $output".

I would not recommend sed as a compiler implementation language, but
it's definitely in keeping with the spirit of brainfuck.
